  ## Installation

  Download the code in your local machine and run `npm install` in the terminal. Also make sure 'node' is installed in your machine. To run the tests enter `npm run test` in the terminal and for testing you need jest package, run `npm install --save-dev jest` to install it and add "test": "jest" in the 'scripts' in package.json. 

  ## Usage

  Run index.js in the terminal by typing `node index`, once you hit enter you are prompted with questions about your logo. After you answer all the questions,  your 'logo.svg' file is generated in the examples folder. When you open the .svg file 
  in the browser you can see the logo with desired text, color and shape.
